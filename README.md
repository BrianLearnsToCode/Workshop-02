# The Internship Network in the Mathematical Sciences

## Workshop #2 - Statistical Methods
This material is part of the INMAS Workshop Series.

This Workshop is a basic introduction to ....

Here is an overview of the notebooks that are part of Workshop #1. The two columns on the right gives an estimated time required to complete each notebook. We anticipate that you will have sufficient time to complete the core parts of the training during the Workshop. The optional parts are there to help you improve your skills and should not be completed during the Workshop unless you already have a good basis in Stastistics. For beginners, we suggest that you revisit these notebooks at a later time. This will help you assimilate the material and ensure a continuity in practicing a new skill.
